# Django for Beginners - Learning Project

This repository contains my implementation of projects from William Vincent's book "Django for Beginners". The goal is to learn Django by building practical web applications.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each project covered in the book. Each project builds upon the concepts learned in the previous ones.
